From the base folder:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m build

Upload the files:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* # use this for tests
python3 -m twine upload dist/* #use this for real deal


Installing your newly uploaded package:
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps lexisnexis_api


python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

this worked once too:
python setup.py sdist



python3 -m build
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
